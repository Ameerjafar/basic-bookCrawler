Following a low second quarter, the industry is ramping up as the end of year approaches. Solar accounted for 58% of all new electricity-generating capacity added to the US grid through the third quarter of 2025, with more than 30 GW installed. Solar and storage, combined, accounted for 85% of new capacity in this timeframe. The US added 4.7 GW of solar module manufacturing capacity in Q3, bringing the total to 60.1 GW. Additionally, new wafer manufacturing capacity was brought online via the Corning facility in Michigan. This has brought manufacturing capability across the whole solar value chain, including polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells, and modules in the US. The actual production of these facilities still remains below domestic demand, however. In Q3 2025, the residential segment installed 1,088 MWdc of solar capacity, declining 4% year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Despite an industry rush to bring projects online this year to qualify for tax credits, equipment constraints are holding back installation growth. The commercial solar segment grew 9% year-over-year and declined 12% quarter-over-quarter with 554 MWdc of new capacity. There were healthy installations in California as the pipeline of NEM 2.0 installations continues to come online. However, the state’s policy-driven surge began to wane this quarter. The community solar segment installed 267 MWdc in Q3 2025, declining 21% year-over-year and growing 12% quarter-over-quarter. The first projects in New Mexico’s program came online, four years after the program was originally established. The utility-scale segment installed 9.7 GWdc in Q3 2025, increasing 26% year-over-year and 68% quarter-", "content_length": 3410, "keywords": "solar panel market analysis"},

The utility segment dominates the market owing to increasing installation targets and the high operating efficiency of PV panels compared to other counterparts. Large-scale photovoltaic power plants, consisting of many PV arrays installed together, prove helpful utilities. Utilities can build PV plants much more quickly than conventional power plants as the arrays are easy to install and can connect electrically. Solar energy adoption across residential segments is increasing due to increasing energy demand. The number of residential construction projects is increasing along with the growing public awareness regarding using renewable and efficient energy sources for residential purposes. Therefore, such factors are expected to drive the residential segment’s growth.", "content_length": 868, "keywords": "solar panel market analysis"},
